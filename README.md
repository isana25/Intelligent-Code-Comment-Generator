## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Comment Generation
```python
# Input Code
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generated Output
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursive approach.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (non-negative integer)
        
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
        
    Time Complexity: O(2^n) - exponential due to repeated calculations
    Space Complexity: O(n) - recursion stack depth
    
    Note: This implementation is inefficient for large n values.
    Consider using dynamic programming for better performance.
    """
```

### Advanced Class Documentation
```python
# Input Code
class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
    
    def insert(self, val):
        # Implementation details...

# Generated Output
class BinarySearchTree:
    """
    A Binary Search Tree implementation with basic insertion operations.
    
    Maintains the BST property: left child < parent < right child
    Provides O(log n) average case performance for insertions.
    
    Attributes:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the tree
    """
```
